# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH SKR mini
# E3 v3.0. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32G0B1 with a "8KiB bootloader" and USB communication.

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR mini E3. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR
# mini E3 with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

drop_first_result: True
dock_position: 249,20,15
#   The physical position of the probe dock relative to the origin of
#   the bed. The coordinates are specified as a comma separated X, Y, Z
#   list of values. Certain dock designs are independent of the Z axis.
#   If Z is specified the toolhead will move to the Z location before the X, Y
#   coordinates.
#   This parameter is required.
approach_position: 249,20,15
#   The X, Y, Z position where the toolhead needs to be prior to moving into the
#   dock so that the probe is aligned properly for attaching or detaching.
#   If Z is specified the toolhead will move to the Z location before the X, Y
#   coordinates.
#   This parameter is required.
detach_position: 230,20,2
#   Similar to the approach_position, the detach_position is the coordinates
#   where the toolhead is moved after the probe has been docked.
#   For magnetically coupled probes, this is typically perpendicular to
#   the approach_position in a direction that does not cause the tool to
#   collide with the printer.
#   If Z is specified the toolhead will move to the Z location before the X, Y
#   coordinates.
#   This parameter is required.
extract_position: 230,20,15
#   Similar to the approach_position, the extract_position is the coordinates
#   where the toolhead is moved to extract the probe from the dock.
#   If Z is specified the toolhead will move to the Z location before the X, Y
#   coordinates.
#   The default value is approach_probe value.
insert_position: 249,20,15
#   Similar to the extract_position, the insert_position is the coordinates
#   where the toolhead is moved before inserting the probe into the dock.
#   If Z is specified the toolhead will move to the Z location before the X, Y
#   coordinates.
#   The default value is extract_probe value.
#safe_dock_distance :
#   This setting defines a security area around dock during ATTACH/DETACH_PROBE
#   commands. While inside the area, the toolhead move away prior to reach the
#   approach or insert position.
#   Default is the smallest distance to the dock of approach, detach, insert
#   position. It could be only lower than the Default value.
#safe_position : approach_position
#   A safe position to ensure MOVE_AVOIDING_DOCK travel does not move the
#   toolhead out of range.
z_hop: 15.0
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to attaching/detaching the probe.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than `z_hop`, then this will lift the head to a height of `z_hop`. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by `z_hop`.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
restore_toolhead: True
#   While True, the position of the toolhead is restored to the position prior
#   to the attach/detach movements.
#   The default value is True.
#dock_retries:
#   The number of times to attempt to attach/dock the probe before raising
#   an error and aborting probing.
#   The default is 0.
auto_attach_detach: True
#   Enable/Disable the automatic attaching/detaching of the probe during
#   actions that require the probe.
#   The default is True.
attach_speed:70
detach_speed:100
travel_speed:150
#   Optional speeds used during moves.
#   The default is to use `speed` of `probe` or 5.0.
check_open_attach: True
#   The probe status should be verified prior to homing. Setting this option
#   to true will check the probe "endstop" is "open" after attaching and
#   will abort probing if not, also checking for "triggered" after docking.
#   Conversively, setting this to false, the probe should read "triggered"
#   after attaching and "open" after docking. If not, probing will abort.
#probe_sense_pin:
#   This supplemental pin can be defined to determine an attached state
#   instead of check_open_attach.
#dock_sense_pin:
#   This supplemental pin can be defined to determine a docked state in
#   addition to probe_sense_pin or check_open_attach.

#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
split_delta_z: 0.015
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will

move_check_distance: 3
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.

#   is 5.0.
mesh_pps: 4,4
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of

#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
